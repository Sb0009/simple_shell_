.SH Command Execution
After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments.

If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it. If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked. If the name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins. If a match is found, that builtin is invoked
.SH Environment
\simple_shell takes a copy from \fBBash\fR environment of the parent process where it was executed. The environment is an array of strings containing the variables in the format.
When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment. This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.
.SH BUILTINS
Builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (indicated by a corresponding error message).
The following builtin commands are supported:
.B exit [Status]

- Exit the shell

.PP ARGUMENTS
If arguments remain after option processing, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell's commands. simple_shell reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. Simple_shell's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.

\&
.SH INVOCATION
simple_shell is started with the standard input connected to the terminal (as determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), the interactive mode is executed. Also non-interactively option can be executed.
When simple_shell  is executed interactively, the prompt is displayed  \#c_is_fun$ \fR to read any command, the command line argument is invoked and is treated as the first argument.
